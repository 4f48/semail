Security Enhanced Mail, or Secure E-Mail

### What even is this?
This is a modern, fast, and convenient internet mailing server and client. Multiple servers will be able to talk to each other, creating a federated network of SE-Mail servers, just like regular E-Mail, but without any of the complexity. Just fire up the server, the client, and with minimal configuration, you're good to go.
